[Meta-analysis of renal single cell and single nucleus transcriptomics reveals the consensus signatures of kidney cell types](https://github.com/MarceauQuatredeniers/Meta-analysis-of-renal-sc-sn-RNAseq) 
<br />
<ins>Abstract:</ins> While the amount of studies involving single cell or single nucleus RNA-sequencing technologies grows exponentially within the biomedical research area, the renal field suffers from a lack of reference transcriptomic signatures to allocate each cluster its matching cell type. The present meta-analysis of 39 previously published datasets, from 7 independent studies, involving healthy human adult kidney samples, offers a set of 30 distinct consensus renal cell type signatures. Using these signatures may assure the reliability of cell type identification in future studies involving single cell or single nucleus transcriptomics  in the renal field while improving the reproducibility in cell type allocation.


Briefly, this study aimed to provide to the nephrology community two sets of transcriptomic signatures
