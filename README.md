<ins>Abstract:</ins> While the amount of studies involving single cell or single nucleus RNA-sequencing technologies grows exponentially within the biomedical research area, the renal field suffers from a lack of reference transcriptomic signatures to allocate each cluster its matching cell type. The present meta-analysis of 39 previously published datasets, from 7 independent studies, involving healthy human adult kidney samples, offers a set of 30 distinct consensus renal cell type signatures. Using these signatures may assure the reliability and reproducibility of cell type identification in future studies involving single cell or single nucleus transcriptomics in the renal field.
